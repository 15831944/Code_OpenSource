    "Description": "This is a reminder for me to fix it at some point. This is from David.\n \nThe problems, I believe, lie in DrawingDeserializer and affects not only Tabula but also Paste in the Live Geometry WPF build. I’ve fixed one problem – DrawingDeserializer.ReadFigureList() needs a drawing argument which gets used when generating unique names.  That fix is included in code I just checked in. The second problem, should probably be fixed by you.  DrawingDeserializer.ReadFigure() results in an error when PasteAction acts on multiple figures.  This is because PasteAction does not add each new figure to the Drawing as they are instantiated so subsequent figures cannot generate  unique names.",
