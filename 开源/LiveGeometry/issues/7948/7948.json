    "Description": "If you delete the coordinate grid from the Figure List (with the del key), it is pretty hard to get it back. The only thing that you can do it ctrl+z.\nÂ \nClicking 'grid' under coordinates doesn't work, and selecting 'show coordinated axes and grids' from the settings menu gives you something that looks quite weird.",
