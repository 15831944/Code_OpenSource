    "Description": "I discovered this problem when I tried to create an ellipse arc on top of a circular arc.  What happens is two dependencies of the ellipse depend on the same object.  Apparently an object can occur in the dependency list only once.  For the current scheme to work, duplicates should be allowed in the dependency list.  This problem also affects other shapes.  Try creating a circle by radius where the radius is defined by the center and the point on the circumference.\nÂ \nHave not looked into it yet.  Obviously has to do with collections.",
