    "Description": "Hi Kirill,\nWhen I made a polyline and then saved it to disk, I noticed that when I tried to load the .lgf file it would fail everytime.  When I added the condition \"if (Drawing != null)\" to the \"UpdateVisual\" method of the Polyline.cs class it seemed to solve the problem.  I didn't see any ramifications of putting this safety code there.  However, I am not sure why the Drawing was null in the first place.  But, I just wanted to make you aware of it.  Thanks again for an awesome project and making it open source.  You rock!\n \nChris\n \n        public override void UpdateVisual()\n        {\n            //CR when deserializing polyline from disk Drawing is null\n            //CR this helped to prevent runtime error\n            if (Drawing != null)\n            {\n                Shape.Points = Drawing.CoordinateSystem\n                    .ToPhysical(Dependencies.ToPoints())\n                    .ToPointCollection();\n            }\n        }",
