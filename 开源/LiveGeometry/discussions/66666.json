So to prevent people from downloading outdated information, I will not publish any releases and people can directly download the latest source code from the Source Code tab.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, you can always view and use the application live at <a href=\"http://livegeometry.com\">http://livegeometry.com</a></p>\r\n<p>Let me know if you have any questions,</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Kirill Osenkov</p>",
