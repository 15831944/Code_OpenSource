In my work on television I spend a lot of time and attention on the GUI--the &quot;Look &amp; Feel&quot; of a TV show or software application is what draws people...&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Many people, like myself prefer working on a Grid that has NO negative axes and the origin is in the lower right-hand corner of the screen.</p>\r\n<p>How would you eliminate the negative axes and position the Origin in the lower left-hand corner of the screen just showing the positive x-axis and poitive y-axis?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n",
