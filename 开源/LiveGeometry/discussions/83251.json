There usually is one green &quot;anchor&quot; point for every selected figure and everything rotates around this figure.</p>\r\n<p>I can't promise implementing it in the near future since I'm very busy these days. However if you'd want to implement it yourself, I'd start with a new behavior based on Dragger (possible called RotationBehavior?)</p>\r\n<p>Maybe in a couple of months I'll get to it...</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Kirill</p>",
