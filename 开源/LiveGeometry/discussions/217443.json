You can install the latest Silverlight 4 Tools for Visual Studio 2010 at <a href=\"http://www.silverlight.net\">www.silverlight.net</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately Silverlight 4 doesn't work with VS 2008 so if you'd like to continue using the Silverlight version, I recommend to install VS 2010 and Silverlight 4. There is a free express edition (Visual Studio Web Developer Express 2010) that works with Silverlight 4.</p>",
